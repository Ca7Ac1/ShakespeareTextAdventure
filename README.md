# ShakespeareTextAdventure
A text based adventure game based on Hamlet.

Python code was to create an ai to generate Hamlet lines. While it works, no meaningful lines could be generated with combination of the algorithm I chose and the amount of data I used. 

C++ code was to play through the text based adventure game. Reades through text files to generate the story 

All .txt files in /story are the files used for the text based adventure. All lines not surrounded in quotes are my own. Lines surrounded in quotes are lines from Hamlet, or a combination of my own words and Hamlet's words.
