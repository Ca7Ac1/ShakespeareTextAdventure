# ShakespeareTextAdventure
A text based adventure game based on Hamlet.

You can try to run the game via these steps:
  - click the green code button
  - download the project as a zip file
  - Unpack the zip somewhere
  - Go go the unpacked project via a terminal (command prompt)
  - run ./Main.exe
  - If you are on Windows 10 and this results in some error, you can try to recomile the c++ code (compile Main.cpp, StoryElement.cpp, and File.cpp) and run again
  - If you are on a different OS you can also try to recompile, but there is no guarantee it works
  

Python code was to create an ai to generate Hamlet lines. While it works, no meaningful lines could be generated with combination of the algorithm I chose and the amount of data I used. 

C++ code was to play through the text based adventure game. Reades through text files to generate the story 

All .txt files in /story are the files used for the text based adventure. All lines not surrounded in quotes are my own. Lines surrounded in quotes are lines from Hamlet, or a combination of my own words and Hamlet's words.
