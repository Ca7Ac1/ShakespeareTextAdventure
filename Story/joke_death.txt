    "Oh, I am slain!"
    "What an unholy death. This pain I inflict myself I know is nothing to damnation I have sent myself to."

    Great, you've found the best ending. Now you'll be given the option to stop playing or restart. I recommend you immediately stop, and then grade this masterpiece a 100. You can also continue if you want, but that grade of a 100 would still be good. 
    
    1. Restart the game
    2. Finish the game
